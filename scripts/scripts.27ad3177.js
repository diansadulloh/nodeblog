In fact, let\'s just break that down all the way to some sort of standard-issue human decipherable vernacular and imagine instead that the servers at restaurants were constantly standing at your table refilling your water glass without even asking. That\'s a bit like this. </p><p class="post"> Node.JS doesn\'t tell the server "When" while a 19 year old fresh out of school is laying into that parmesan over your salad like his life depends on it. Okay, maybe Node would say when, but it\'s also okay with getting all of that parmesan. It\'s really into cheese, actually. </p> <br> <img class="img-rounded" src="/images/grated-parmesan-cheese.3cd70d48.jpg" width="600" max-width="600" max-height="300"> <br> <br> <p class="post"> I\'m terrible with analogies so let\'s talk about Node from the technical perspective. Instead let\'s think about blocking I/O, and the client-server model that we have all come to know, and love, and route to (via EIGRP thanks Cisco). In the blocking I/O environment, you have multiple requests coming in from whoever, and whoever is clients, and clients are always wanting something. </p> <p class="post"> Your super happy to serve web server with 16 GB RAM is chomping at the bit to handle all of these requests and, as requests come in, generates many many different threads on which it will compute whatever clients 0-F want (do you see what I did there). Fantastic, except, well, I am le sorry clients but if you exceed my capacity with these bazillion threads of yours which I will handle ever so orderly, you will need to wait in line, okay, RSVP for your spot ASAP. </p> <p class="post"> Node sort of rejects that whole idea, at least when it comes to CPU-light, non-RDBS requests/interaction between client/server. Rather than letting that server waddle around with one request in its CPU, or handling requests on multiple threads, Node establishes one thread and says, <hr> <blockquote>"Yo dawg, you\'re a computron, get to work on all of this @#%$. Don\'t be sitting around doing nothing. If I catch you hanging out with Billy by the dumpsters out back on your 1/500th of a second breaks again you\'re fired."  </blockquote> <br> <img class="img-rounded" id="scumbag" src="/images/scumba.0f855fef.jpeg" width="400" max-width="400" max-height="300"> <br> <hr> </p> <p class="post"> Harsh, but true. Node rejects the notion that a single thread per request is acceptable, furthermore it acknowledges and corrects for the inefficiency of a server moving across threads as it addresses them. Rather Node manages - thanks based Ryan Dahl - to organize these requests into one thread of events that is perpetually handled by a server which does not take breaks, because it shouldn\'t, because it\'s a computer. </p>  </div> </div> </div> <hr> </div>'),a.put("views/post.html","<p>This is the post view.</p>")}]);
